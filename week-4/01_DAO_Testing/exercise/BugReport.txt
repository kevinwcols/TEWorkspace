Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee @Test method
Code to catch error:
List<Timesheet> timesheets = dao.getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1);
Assert.assertEquals("getTimesheetsByEmployeeId failed to return all timesheets for employees", 2, timesheets.size());

Expected output: 2

Actual output: 1

How did you fix this bug?
When looping through results the getTimesheetsByEmployeeId method was using a if instead of while so I changed it to while.
The if was only returning 1 record, the while looped through all results and returned 2 total records.


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project
Code to catch error:
List<Timesheet> timesheets = dao.getTimesheetsByProjectId(1);
Assert.assertEquals("getTimesheetsByProjectId failed to return all timesheets for projects", 3, timesheets.size());

Expected output: 3

Actual output: 2

How did you fix this bug?
Changed "WHERE employee_id = ? " + to "WHERE project_id = ? " +

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total
Code to catch error:
double timesheetBillableHours = dao.getBillableHours(2,2);
Assert.assertEquals(0, timesheetBillableHours, 0.0);

Expected output: 0

Actual output: 2

How did you fix this bug?
Changed "WHERE employee_id = ? AND project_id = ?"; to "WHERE billable and employee_id = ? AND project_id = ?";

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved
Code to catch error:
Timesheet timesheet = dao.getTimesheet(1);
timesheet.setBillable(false);
dao.updateTimesheet(timesheet);
updatedTimesheet = dao.getTimesheet(1);
Assert.assertEquals("updateTimesheet failed to change timesheet billable flag in database", false, updatedTimesheet.isBillable());


Expected output:  false

Actual output:  true

How did you fix this bug?
- Changed "SET employee_id = ?, project_id = ?, date_worked = ?, hours_worked = ?, description = ? " +
       to "SET employee_id = ?, project_id = ?, date_worked = ?, hours_worked = ?, description = ?, billable = ? " +
- Added the IsBillable() getter to the results:
    jdbcTemplate.update(sql, updatedTimesheet.getEmployeeId(), updatedTimesheet.getProjectId(),
                    updatedTimesheet.getDateWorked(), updatedTimesheet.getHoursWorked(), updatedTimesheet.getDescription(),
                    updatedTimesheet.isBillable(), updatedTimesheet.getTimesheetId());
